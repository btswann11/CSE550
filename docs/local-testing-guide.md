# Universal Translator Local Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for team members to run and test the Universal Translator application locally. The application is an Azure Functions-based real-time chat platform with automatic translation capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 8.0 SDK** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- **Azure Functions Core Tools v4** - [Installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- **Visual Studio Code** (recommended) with Azure Functions extension
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Verify Prerequisites

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
# Check .NET version
dotnet --version

# Check Azure Functions Core Tools
func --version

# Should show version 4.x.x
```

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone and Navigate to Project

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CSE550/src/UniversalTranslator
```

### 2. Restore NuGet Packages

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Create local.settings.json

**CRITICAL:** Create a `local.settings.json` file in the `/src/UniversalTranslator/` directory. This file contains sensitive configuration data that will be shared separately via secure channels.

Create the `local.settings.json` file with the following content

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "AzureSignalRConnectionString": "Endpoint=https://cse550-universal-translator-signalr.service.signalr.net;AccessKey=[TO_BE_PROVIDED];Version=1.0;",

    "UT_TRANSLATION_SERVICE_BASE_URI": "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/",
    "UT_TRANSLATION_SERVICE_API_KEY": "[TO_BE_PROVIDED]",
    "UT_TRANSLATION_SERVICE_LOCATION": "eastus",

    "UT_CHATS_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING": "[TO_BE_PROVIDED]",
    "UT_CHATS_TABLE_NAME": "utchats-<your-name>",

    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",        
  }
}
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Replace `<your-name>` with your actual name or identifier to avoid conflicts during local testing. Each person will have their own backend table for storing chat data.
- Replace `[TO_BE_PROVIDED]` values with the actual connection strings and keys I'll provide separately
- **DO NOT commit this file to Git** - it contains sensitive information
- The file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Visual Studio Enterprise (Recommended)

1. **Open the solution file:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Enterprise
   - Go to `File > Open > Project/Solution`

dotnet run
```

## Port Configuration

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PORT INFORMATION:**

- **Default Port:** The application is configured to run on port `7151`
- **DO NOT change this port** without coordination
- The port is configured in:
  - `launchSettings.json` (line 5): `"commandLineArgs": "--port 7151"`
  - `local.settings.json`: `"LocalHttpPort": 7151`
  - `index.html` (line 7): `window.apiBaseUrl = 'http://localhost:7151'`

**If you MUST change the port:**

1. Contact me immediately to update upstream server-side configurations
2. Update all three files above consistently
3. Restart the application completely

## Browser Developer Tools - CRITICAL for Debugging

**üîß ALWAYS Open Browser Developer Tools When Testing**

When testing the web interface, it's essential to have your browser's developer tools open to capture any errors. This information is crucial for troubleshooting and getting help from the team.

### How to Open Developer Tools

**Chrome/Edge:**

- Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Or right-click on the page and select "Inspect"

**Firefox:**

- Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Or right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element"

**Safari:**

- Press `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Or go to `Develop > Show Web Inspector` (enable Develop menu in Preferences first)

### Key Tabs to Monitor

1. **Console Tab** - Shows JavaScript errors and log messages
   - Look for red error messages
   - Yellow warnings may also be important
   - Network connection errors will appear here

2. **Network Tab** - Shows API calls and responses
   - Filter by "Fetch/XHR" to see API calls
   - Look for failed requests (red status codes)
   - Check response bodies for error details

3. **Application/Storage Tab** - Shows local storage and session data
   - Check if SignalR connections are established
   - Verify API base URL configuration

### What to Capture When Reporting Issues

**Before contacting for help, please capture:**

1. **Console Errors:**
   - Take a screenshot of the Console tab showing any red errors
   - Copy the full error text (right-click error ‚Üí "Copy message")

2. **Network Failures:**
   - Screenshot of the Network tab showing failed requests
   - Click on failed requests to see details
   - Copy the request URL and response body

3. **Browser Information:**
   - Note which browser and version you're using
   - Include operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux)

### Common Error Patterns to Watch For

**SignalR Connection Issues:**

```javascript
Error: Failed to start the connection: Error: WebSocket failed to connect.
```

**API Connection Issues:**

```javascript
Error: Failed to fetch
TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
```

**CORS Issues:**

```javascript
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:7151/api/...' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Translation Service Issues:**

```javascript
Error: Translation service returned error: [specific error message]
```

### Testing Workflow with Developer Tools

1. **Open the application** in your browser: `http://localhost:7151/api/content/index.html`
2. **Open Developer Tools** immediately (F12)
3. **Clear the console** (click the clear icon or press Ctrl+L)
4. **Perform your test actions** (join chat, send messages, etc.)
5. **Monitor for errors** in real-time
6. **Capture screenshots** of any errors before they scroll away
7. **Test network connectivity** by checking the Network tab

### Quick Debug Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify in browser dev tools:

- [ ] No red errors in Console tab
- [ ] API calls in Network tab are returning 200 status codes
- [ ] SignalR connection is established (check Console for connection messages)
- [ ] No CORS errors preventing API access
- [ ] Browser can reach `http://localhost:7151/api/isusernameavailable/test`

**üí° Pro Tip:** Keep developer tools open during your entire testing session. Many errors are transient and might be missed if you only open the tools after problems occur.

## Local Debug Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
- [ ] Azure Functions Core Tools v4 is installed
- [ ] `local.settings.json` exists with correct values
- [ ] Port 7151 is available
- [ ] All NuGet packages are restored
- [ ] Project builds successfully (`dotnet build`)
- [ ] Basic endpoint responds (`curl http://localhost:7151/api/isusernameavailable/test`)
